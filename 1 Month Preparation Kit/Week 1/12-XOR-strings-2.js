// ! This problem worked with Node.js
// ? With two inputs, XOR is true if and only if the inputs differ (one is true, one is false).

// Given two strings consisting of digits 0 and 1 only, find the XOR of the two strings.
// Debug the given function strings_xor to find the XOR of the two given strings appropriately.
// ! Note: You can modify at most three lines in the given code and you cannot add or remove lines to the code.

// Input Format
// The input consists of two lines. The first line of the input contains the first string, s
// and the second line contains the second string, t.
